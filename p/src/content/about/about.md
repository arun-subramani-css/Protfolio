Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a Web & IoT Solutions Creator based out of Tamil Nadu, India.

I'm an aspiring developer with a passion for building intuitive, user-friendly applications on the web and IoT platforms. I'm well acquainted with various UX design & research methods as well as frontend, cloud, and database technologies. I believe in the human element of design and understanding the audience, so I strive to create simple, functional, and impactful user experiences. I primarily code in Python and JavaScript, and design with Figma and Adobe XD.

In my free time, I enjoy badminton, swimming, and cooking. Always down to brainstorm ideas 💡
